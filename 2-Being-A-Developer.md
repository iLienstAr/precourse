# Coding is Communication

 > “The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code.”  – Uncle Bob Martin

Software developers, especially in small to medium sized companies, are responsible for more than just typing code.  You will sit in a key position between customers, marketers, designers, managers, deployment machines, and your fellow developers.  At the end of the day it is your responsibility to ensure that there is a working application which fits the end user's needs, deploys smoothly on the necessary platforms, and is scalable and maintainable. 

Source code is your final product.  After hours of planning, emailing, testing, coding, and getting stuck on bugs, all that's left is the source code.  And there's no guarantee that you'll be the one to maintain your code.  This means it's crucial for you to embed everything you know about the project directly into your code. Completed source code is the most powerful tool you have for sharing your knowledge of the application. 

Your finished code needs to be understandable to 3 very different, and equally important audiences:
1. End Users must understand why they're using your software and how to use it
2. Developers must understand how to test, maintain, expand, and re-use your code
3. Deployment Environments must receive carefully tuned, compiled code or risk crashing

We like to think a lot about number 2, and hopefully you will too.

Before you dive into the hard stuff, it's worth taking a moment to get your head in the right place.  Some of the resources below will help you set expectations for how much you'll need to work and what kind of progress you can expect to make in your time with Hack Your Future.  Some of these resources are about what developers actually do in their work.  The rest of the resources will give you an overview of the technologies you will be learning.

## Your Task


1. Every time you read or write a line of code ask yourself three questions:
    * Does this help the user?
    * Does this help the maintainer?
    * Does this help runtime execution?
2. Read A LOT of code.  Print it out on paper if you have to.
3. Start building your Developer Vocabulary.
